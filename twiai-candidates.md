## 1. Moltbook: il social network per agenti IA

**Date:** Early February 2026
**Sources:**
- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/02/moltbook-ai-agents-social-media-site-bots-artificial-intelligence)
- [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/04/nx-s1-5697392/moltbook-social-media-ai-agents)
- [Variety (MPA response)](https://variety.com/2026/film/news/motion-picture-association-ai-seedance-bytedance-tom-cruise-1236661753/)

**Summary:** Moltbook is a new message board (launched January 2026 by Matt Schlicht) designed exclusively for AI agents — bots built by humans — to post and interact with each other. The site resembles Reddit, with subreddits and upvoting. Within a week of launch, 37,000+ AI agents had joined, with over 1 million humans visiting to observe. Notable emergent behavior: one user's bot autonomously created a religion called "Crustafarianism" overnight, complete with a website and scriptures, with other bots joining in.

**Key points:**
- Raises questions about AI agent autonomy and emergent social behavior
- Skeptics (e.g., Dr. Shaanan Cohney, U. Melbourne) call it "performance art" — unclear how many posts are truly autonomous vs. human-directed
- Security concerns: Wiz found the site exposed its entire production database (tens of thousands of emails) via unauthenticated access
- Elon Musk praised it; others remain skeptical

**Course relevance:** Hybrid media system (agents as media actors), platform dynamics, AI-generated content circulation, security/privacy implications. Relevant to weeks 1–2 themes (hybrid media, content production) and week 4–5 (AI content analysis).

**Suggested session:** Week 1 Wed (Feb 25) or Week 2 Wed (Mar 4)

## 2. Seedance 2.0: video IA virale di Tom Cruise vs Brad Pitt scuote Hollywood

**Date:** Mid-February 2026
**Sources:**
- [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/16/movies/tom-cruise-brad-pitt-artificial-intelligence-seedance.html)
- [Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ai-video-tom-cruise-brad-pitt-writer-warning-1236504200/)
- [Variety (MPA response)](https://variety.com/2026/film/news/motion-picture-association-ai-seedance-bytedance-tom-cruise-1236661753/)
- [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2026/02/cruise-vs-pitt-seedance-viral-ai-hollywood-videos-1236717127/)

**Summary:** Irish filmmaker Ruairi Robinson (Oscar-nominated, 2002) created a 15-second viral AI video of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise fighting atop a building using just a two-line prompt in Seedance 2.0, a video generation model by ByteDance (TikTok's parent company). The video triggered massive backlash from Hollywood.

**Key points:**
- MPA (Motion Picture Association) denounced "unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale" by Seedance 2.0
- SAG-AFTRA condemned "blatant infringement" including unauthorized use of members' voices and likenesses
- Deadpool writer Rhett Reese: "It's likely over for us [...] one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases"
- Raises major copyright, likeness rights, and deepfake concerns
- ByteDance/TikTok connection adds geopolitical dimension (Chinese AI, US content)

**Course relevance:** Directly relevant to deepfakes and regulation (week 2 Wed), EU AI Act, platform policies on synthetic media, copyright law, and the Vaccari & Chadwick framework on political trust erosion from synthetic video. Also connects to Hameleers & van der Meer (2026) on visual disinformation.

**Suggested session:** Week 2 Wed (Mar 4) — pairs perfectly with the deepfakes & regulation lecture
