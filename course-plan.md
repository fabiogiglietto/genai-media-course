## Group Project: AI Slop Reception Analysis

### Project Overview

Students will work in groups of 4–6 to produce a research paper analyzing AI-generated content ("AI Slop") on Meta platforms, with a focus on user reception in comments. The project applies the LLMs-in-the-loop methodology to validate AI-assisted analysis against human coding.

### Research Focus

- Identifying and classifying AI-generated visual content (synthetic images, engagement bait)
- Analyzing user comments and reactions to AI Slop content
- Using Gemini to process large datasets of posts and comments
- Validating AI classifications through human coding comparison
- Connecting findings to platform policies and EU Code of Practice on Disinformation

### Methodology

Following Marino & Giglietto (2024), groups will develop LLMs-in-the-loop pipelines using Google Gemini to analyze content at scale, then validate results through systematic human coding. This dual approach addresses both the practical challenge of large datasets and the methodological need for reliability assessment.

### Timeline & Milestones

| Week | Date | Milestone |

| Week 4 | Mar 16 | Terenzi seminar on AI Slop research methodology |
| Week 4 | Mar 17 | Group formation & research question development |
